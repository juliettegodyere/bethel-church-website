**Where to locate each file that should have dynamic content**

1. public/js/sermons - holds an array of sermons objects. Open it up and add new sermon objects and it will be added to the sermons that displays on the web app.
2. public/js/live - paste the url to the live streaming sermon and the bbc-tv page will show the live sermon video.
3. public/js/scripts - edit the date in line #11 to change the countdown date.

**How to run the project locally**

1. Clone this repository
2. Open up your terminal and run "npm install" to install all dependencies.
3. Run node app.js to start the application
4. In your brower, navigate to "http://localhost:8000/"

<!-- **Creating an application**

Prepare your app for the project.
1. Clone this application.
2. Have a look at the sample application's structure â€” the website folder contains your website content and app.yaml is your application configuration file.
Your website content must go inside the website folder, and its landing page must be called index.html, but apart from that it can take whatever form you like.
The app.yaml file is a configuration file that tells App Engine how to map URLs to your static files. You don't need to edit it.

**Publishing your application**
Now that we've got the project made and app files collected together, let's publish our app.

1. Open Google Cloud Shell.
2. clone the app
`git clone git clone https://github.com/juliettegodyere/bethel-church-website.git`
3. Go to the bethel-church-website folder `cd bethel-church-website`
4. run `gcloud app deploy` in the GC console
